Analyze my staged changes using the `git` MCP server. 

Cross-reference the files with the project structure using `filesystem`.

To ensure a high-quality commit message, you should read necessary project files. The `README.md` often contains important context about the project.

If it's a 'feat' or 'fix', ensure the scope matches the primary module directory.
